I enjoy playing a lot of video games. I try to play a variety of games from puzzle games to fps games. 
They are a great pastime and are a good mental workout. I mainly play on my Xbox One but I have quite a 
few other consoles as well. From oldest to newest I have a NES, SNES, N64, Xbox (orig), Game Cube, Wii, Xbox
360 , Ps2, Ps3, and a Ps4. I enjoy playing games on all of these consoles because they all have a different 
style and individual specific games as well. If you want to get invested in video games I would suggest that 
you play a variety of games and dont get turned off the idea of playing because one game was bad. There are so many games 
out that Im sure there is a genre for you. Also video games come in all shapes and sizes, if you are not to big into 
crazy graphics , and the best power from a game, then you could just get a low end console. Or if you want to game on the go
then buy a handheld. There are many ways to find an interest in video games so if you just pick up anything Im sure you will
enjoy it.
