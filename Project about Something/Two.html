 Working out has always been a great way for me to take my mind off things, and in a weird way relax. 
 I go to the gym a few times a week and try to workout a specific part of my body at each trip. For examle, one day 
 will be leg day, while the next would be chest. The gym I go to is only a block away from my house so its nice that
 I dont have to travel very far. I like going to the gym with a buddy or two because it is nice motivation. If you want
 to get into going to the gym I would suggest you first pay for a trial plan so you can get to know if you will want to continue. 
 If you decide that you want to continue then during your first month or so go pretty light on everything because your body 
 will not be used to the conditions. For extra assistance getting a personal trainer is not a bad idea because they
 will teach you how to use all of the equipment. But just so you know, working out does not just affect you 
 when you are at the gym , but when you are at home as well. You will need to be a custom to eating healthier 
 and making better choices otherwise going to the gym is useless.
